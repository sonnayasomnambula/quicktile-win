Yet another tiling window management utility for Windows like:
- WinSplit Revolution;
- quicktile (Linux);
- built-in Smart Window (Snap).

By pressing a hotkey, the window is sent to one of 6 screen zones to occupy one-third, half or two-thirds of the screen width. You can also send the window to another monitor if there are two or more.

Pure WinAPI.
