Yet another tiling window management utility for Windows like:
- [WinSplit Revolution](https://github.com/dozius/winsplit-revolution);
- [quicktile](https://github.com/ssokolow/quicktile) for Linux;
- built-in Smart Window (Snap).

By pressing a hotkey, the window is sent to one of 6 screen zones to occupy one-third, half or two-thirds of the screen width. You can also send the window to another monitor if there are two or more.

Pure WinAPI.

No installer implemented; you can just put the shortcut in `shell:startup` folder.
